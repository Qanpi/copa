# copa what? 
In one sentence, Copa is a web app with intent to revolutionize hosting and participating in our high school's (SYK) soccer tournaments.

Here is some of what Copa brings to the table for participants:
- [x] create lasting, customizable team profiles and invite friends
- [x] check the latest tournament updates anywhere you are on mobile
- [x] view easy-to-understand group stage and play-off standings
- [x] know when and where each match occurs
- [x] follow LIVE score updates
- [ ] explore all teams and matches between them in a graph-like (nodes for teams, edges for matches) map
- [ ] gamble (not real money!) on match outcomes [still in development]

And for organizers:
- [x] oversee registered participants
- [x] notify of last-minute changes with notifications
- [x] draw teams into groups using a fortune wheel
- [x] customize the bracket structure
- [x] schedule and run matches with an in-built timer
- [ ] crown the winner and immortalize memories with pictures [still ironing out]

## copa why? 
A few years back, Eero Koskenvesa (SYK alumn) hosted the first niche, futsal-like tournament, where teams of four battled it out in six minute matches. Copa de Kuutio has since captured the hearts of many in our school (myself included), and typically sees nearly all 600 high school students coming together in a jubilant ceremony.

At the same time, these tournaments were organized through spreadsheets posted on Instagram, requiring a lot of manual labor to both plan and follow. The mission of the Copa web app is to simplify this process, simultaneously introducing new features and preserving tournament history, _while maintaining the Copa spirit and low-barrier to entry_. 

## copa how? 
Copa is the product of a year (and counting) of work, combining both front- and back-end technology to produce a single-page application (SPA). It is built on top of the MERN stack, which is a fusion of MongoDB, Express, React and Node. In addition, the application is currently hosted on Azure. For in-depth technical information and guidance on contributing, refer to the wiki. 

## copa statement
At Copa, we take privacy and consent very seriously. You can find a disclaimer of what data is collected [here](). In addition, almost all features are opt-in, meaning that you have to consent to publicize your profile, your real name is only visible to the organizer, and so on. Again, the application acts as an _opportunity_ to deeper engage with the tournament, _not a mandate_.
